    "### What is `pandas`?\n",
    "At a basic level, `pandas` is a Python library for manipulating & analyzing data. It's best for *tabular data*, which is data that can nicely be organized into a table with rows and columns. Tabular data could look like:\n",
    "* sales from an ecommerce site (each row is a sale, and the columns hold information about the sale -- product(s), time of sale, dollar amount of the purchase, etc.)\n",
    "* a robot's position as it changes over time (each row has a timestamp and x, y, and z coordinates indicating the robot's location)\n",
    "* bikeshare trips (each row is an individual trip with source and destination stations, timestamps, and trip duration)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's okay to store network data in a tabular format; other times, when we're running (e.g.) spreading simulations or network reconstruction, a tabular format is not very helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to be working with non-network tabular data for the most part -- it's easier to get a handle on `pandas` this way. \n",

This means that a row can be identified by the labels in the index column. Each column of a `DataFrame` is also a `Series`. \n",

    "## Regressions\n",
    "Regressions are used to figure out how variables in a dataset are related to each other. Usually, you have a dependent variable (the __outcome__ we care about) and some set of __independent variables__ that influence the outcome. For example, let's say we have a bunch of fish and their dimensional measurements. We want to figure out how much the fish weighs, given its measurements. Regression is one way we can do this!\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most basic form, a linear regression will try to minimize the __sum of squared error__. Let's say we have a bunch of observations $y_i$ and $x_i$. Each $y_i$ is a numeric value, and each $x_i$ is a vector of dependent variables. We want to find a vector $\\beta$ such that $\\sum_{i=0}^{n} (\\beta x_i - y_i)^2$ is minimized. This is also referred to the sum of the squares of the residuals -- __residual__ is another word for how incorrect an individual prediction is. In aggregate, we want the amount that we are wrong to be as small as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "We often use $R^2$, or the [\"coefficient of determination,\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination)  to estimate how well a regression explains data. Formally, it takes the following form:\n",
    "$SS_{res} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} (\\beta x_i - y_i)^2$ is the sum of the squares of the __residuals__ (remember, this is how wrong an individual prediction is).\n",
    "$SS_{tot} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ is the __total sum of squares__ - this is proportional to the variance of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$. In other words, we're asking \"how well are we explaining all the variance in the dataset?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "### When are regressions useful?\n",
    "Regressions are useful for figuring out how different independent variables affect a dependent variable. They are also helpful in predicting how a system might act in the future. For example, if you have a lot of fish and a linear regression model that can predict their weights pretty well, you can then measure even more fish and predict their weights! \n",
    "\n",
    "### When do they fall short?\n",
    "Sometimes data isn't linear! Other times, you might have something that looks like a good fit, but it doesn't explain your data well. [Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) is a good example that explains why just going ahead and fitting a linear model to your data may not always be wise! \n",
    "\n",
    "![Anscombe's Quartet](images/anscombe_quartet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, these datasets are doing very different things, but the linear model that best describes them is the same for all four datasets. It also fits each dataset as well as the next: the $R^2$ is $0.67$ for all the regressions. This is a cautionary tale: sometimes a linear model is simply not the right model!\n",
