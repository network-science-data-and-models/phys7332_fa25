    "## How The Course Works\n",
    "This course offers an introduction to network analysis and is designed to provide students with an overview of the core data scientific skills required to analyze complex networks. Through hands-on lectures, labs, and projects, students will learn actionable skills about network analysis techniques using Python (in particular, the `networkx` library). The course network data collection, data input/output, network statistics, dynamics, and visualization. Students also learn about random graph models and algorithms for computing network properties like path lengths, clustering, degree distributions, and community structure. In addition, students will develop web scraping skills and will be introduced to the vast landscape of software tools for analyzing complex networks. The course ends with a large-scale final project that demonstrates the proficiency of the students in network analysis.\n",

    "## Class Expectations\n",
    "This is a \"new\" class (it had previously been taught as a part of the Network Science PhD program at Northeastern, but for the past 5+ years we've not taught it). We've brought it back after years of realizing that it contains valuable skills for students studying network science, and we're hoping to gain important insights around what skills are essential to teach, what can be assumed prior knowledge, and what is too challenging for students. As such, we'll be asking for frequent feedback on the assignments, classes, etc.\n",

    "### Classroom Interactions\n",
    "This is largely a \"coding\" course. That means we'll all have our computers out and follow along the same notebook as the instructor is teaching. There will be frequent \"your turn\" sections of the code, where we'll expect you to break off into solo / small teams to solve an in-class challenge. When the class comes back together, we'll ask for volunteers to share screen and show off what they've done."

    "## Coursework, Class Structure, Grading\n",
    "This is a twice-weekly hands-on class that emphasizes building experience with coding. This does not necessarily mean every second of every class will be live-coding, but it will inevitably come up in how the class is taught. We are often on the lookout for improving the pedagogical approach to this material, and we would welcome feedback on class structure. The course will be co-taught, featuring lectures from the core instructors as well as outside experts. Grading in this course will be as follows:\n",
    "- Class Attendance \\& Participation: 10%\n",
    "- Problem Sets: 45%\n",
    "- Mid-Semester Project Presentation: 15%\n",
    "- Final Project — Presentation & Report: 30%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Project\n",
    "The final project for this course is a chance for students to synthesize their knowledge of network analysis into pedagogical materials around a topic of their choosing. Modeled after chapters in the Jupyter book for this course, students will be required to make a new \"chapter\" for our class's textbook; this requires creating a thoroughly documented, informative Python notebook that explains an *advanced* topic that was not deeply explored in the course. For these projects, students are required to conduct their own research into the background of the technique, the original paper(s) introducing the topic, and how/if it is currently used in today's network analysis literature. Students will demonstrate that they have mastered this technique by using informative data for illustrating the usefulness of the topic they've chosen. Every chapter should contain informative data visualizations that build on one another, section-by-section. The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the coding skills gained in this course, doing so by learning a new network analysis technique and sharing it with members of the class. Over time, these lessons may find their way into the curriculum for future iterations of this class. Halfway through the semester, there will be project update presentations where students receive class and instructor feedback on their project topics. Throughout, we will be available to brainstorm students' ideas for project topics.\n",

    "#### What is `conda` and why do we use it?\n",
    "Python has the ability to do a lot of things on its own, but sometimes we need to install *packages* that extend Python's functionality. For example, `scikit-learn` has a lot of machine learning algorithms, and `geopy` does handy geographic math (like calculating geodesic distances). Managing the dependencies these packages have on other packages is really annoying and really easy to mess up ([in fact, it is NP-complete,](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28099683/algorithm-for-dependency-resolution), which means it's a very hard type of computational problem), so we use tools called *package managers*. `pip` is one package manager, and `conda` is a fancier one. `conda`, short for `anaconda`, can handle packages that are outside the Python ecosystem, like C compilers, whereas `pip` cannot. \n",

First, let's follow the tutorial [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to create SSH keys, because they explain it way better than I can. \n",

Label them something memorable, like `explorer key`, so you'll know which machine(s) it's attached to.\n",

    "### Syncing the Fork\n",
    "Now we're going to sync our forked repository with the main student repository that I own. We can do this on GitHub, which is neat! This will incorporate all the fancy changes I made (okay, it's basically one script) and let us test out the git update script.

If this script works well enough, it should create a version of any files that you've modified from the original that have `MODIFIED_{a bunch of numbers}.ipynb` at the end of the filename. It will also update any files that have been modified on my end and add any new files that I've created in my repository. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Going Forward\n",
